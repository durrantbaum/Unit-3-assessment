		<h1>My Neighborhood</h1>

		<p>
		My neighborhood is in Lehi, UT and I really enjoy living here! I like how it's basically right in between SLC and Provo. This is 
        convenient for me because I have famliy in Provo and SLC, plus there are two big airports in those two cities that I use for travel.
        Lehi is a pretty quiet city and living in my suburban neighborhood feels relaxing and safe.
